# Classification-Using-Artificial-Vision-with-Raspberry-Pi-and-Universal-Robots
This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi and Python to create an artificial vision system for classifying fruits. A camera captures images processed by a YOLO model, while a Universal Robot automates sorting based on detected fruits, improving efficiency through real-time image processing and socket communication.
